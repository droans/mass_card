# HACS Custom Card Boilerplate

I created this guide to act as a basis for creating new cards.

Plus, I wanted to document, how such a card can be developed straight in Home Assistant's Studio Code Server (vscode).

## Environment Setup

- Set up Studio Code Server integration, launch it, and create a new folder in the main (config) folder
- Use File / Add Folder to Workspace to add it as a root folder
- Initialize git repository in this folder
